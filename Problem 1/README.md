# Problem
This problem asks the following:

Given $N \in \mathbb{N}$, find all natural numbers $n$ with $0 \leq n < N$
such that

$$n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \quad \text{or} \quad n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}.$$

Let these numbers be denoted by $n_1,\dots,n_k$ (where $k$ is their total
number), and compute

$$S = \sum_{i=1}^k n_i.$$

-------
# Example

The example given is when $N = 10$. The numbers that meet the criterion are clearly 

$$\{3,5,6,9\},$$

with the sum 

$$S = \sum_{i=1}^4 n_i = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 = 23 .$$
